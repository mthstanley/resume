{Senior Software Engineer \textnormal{Wayfair}}{April 2018--Present}
{

    \item Drastically improved performance and life-expectancy of Wayfair's
        on-premise HDFS cluster by implementing a process for the compaction of
        small files across the cluster, realizing a 98\% reduction in the
        number of files.

    \item Designed and implemented configuration-based ETL platform to generate
        foundational data assets at petabyte-scale (using HDFS, Hive, Presto,
        Parquet, Spark and Airflow) for Wayfair's Machine Learning and Analytics
        platforms.

    \item Led the engineering effort of multiple high-impact migrations for
        Wayfair's petabyte-scale event ingestion platform: from single to
        multi-datacenter architecture, from running on on-premise infrastructure
        through hybrid cloud to fully on-boarded onto Google Cloud Platform.

    \item Once my team's systems were on-boarded onto GCP, I drove cost saving
        initiatives across our platform leading to almost \$9MM in reduced
        spending.

    \item Lead a team of 3 engineers working on the control plane systems for
        Wayfair's next generation data ingestion platform.
